## Description
PrinterSpammer is a tool for attacking an unsecured office printer. Many printers, especially HP printers, expose a raw TCP/IP socket that reads and prints out the data sent to it. This is a great vector for a DoS attack, and one that can cost significant amounts of money by wasting printer resources such as paper, ink, etc.
